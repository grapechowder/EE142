This is a simple game engine developed at VMI for EE 142 C++ and Object Oriented Programming. 

This version of the game engine is modified for grading on zybooks. We use lots
of #define's to get rid of all slow operations so that the tests can compile
and run to completion. If you try to use the real game engine files, the
zybooks tests will time out.
